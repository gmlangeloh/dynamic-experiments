'''
Basic implementation of F4 reduction in Sage.
It is not meant to be very efficient, but hopefully can compete with
Caboara and Perry's (2014) implementation of classical reductions.

  Build a matrix from a list of pairs L and reduces w.r.t. G.

  Faug√®re reports that the normal strategy works better in his original F4 paper.
