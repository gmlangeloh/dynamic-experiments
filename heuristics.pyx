    Implements the Hilbert heuristic recommended by Caboara in his 1993 paper.

    if one polynomial's degree is smaller than the other,

    Otherwise, it compares the Hilbert series of the polynomials;
    if the two are equal, it returns 0; otherwise,
    it returns the trailing coefficient of the numerator of the difference b/w f's hs and g's.
